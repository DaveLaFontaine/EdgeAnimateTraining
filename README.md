# EdgeAnimateTraining
Resources for my students to use when following along with my Edge Animate training sessions

I'm including some files here for you to use as you follow along with my lessons in Edge Animate. 

You can use whatever assets you like - although I will be providing smoe JPGs, SVGs, and MP3 files for you to play with. These are yours to do with as you like - but if you do actually publish a page using some of my tools and techniques, I would appreciate a link back to my site at http://davidlafontaine.com as an acknowledgment.
